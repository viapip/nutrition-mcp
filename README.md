## Self-hosting

### 1. Supabase setup

1. Create a [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project.
2. Enable **Email Auth** (Authentication → Providers → Email) and disable email confirmation.
3. Apply the schema. The full schema lives in [`supabase/migrations/`](supabase/migrations/). With the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started):

    ```bash
    supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>
    supabase db push
    ```

    This creates every table, index, RLS policy, and foreign key the app needs. No local Postgres is involved — migrations run against your hosted project.

4. Copy the **service role key** from Project Settings → API and use it as `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`.

### 2. Environment variables

| Variable               | Description                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SUPABASE_URL`         | Your Supabase project URL                                                     |
| `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`  | Supabase service role key (bypasses RLS)                                      |
| `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`      | Random string for OAuth client identification                                 |
| `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`  | Random string for OAuth client authentication                                 |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`     | _(optional)_ Google OAuth client ID for "Sign in with Google"                 |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | _(optional)_ Google OAuth client secret                                       |
| `OFF_USER_AGENT`       | Open Food Facts User-Agent for barcode lookups, in the form `AppName (email)` |
| `PORT`                 | Server port (default: `8080`)                                                 |

> **Note:** The HTML files in `public/` include a Google Analytics tag (`G-1K4HRB2R8X`). If you're self-hosting, remove or replace the gtag snippet in `public/index.html`, `public/login.html`, and `public/privacy.html`.

Generate OAuth credentials:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 16   # use as OAUTH_CLIENT_ID
openssl rand -hex 32   # use as OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET
```

### 3. Google sign-in (optional)

Email/password works out of the box. To also offer **"Continue with Google"**,
follow [`docs/google-auth-setup.md`](docs/google-auth-setup.md) to create a
Google OAuth client, enable the Google provider in Supabase, and set
`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.

## Development

```bash
bun install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in your credentials
bun run dev             # starts with hot reload on http://localhost:8080
```

## Connect to Claude.ai

1. Open [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai) and click **Customize**
