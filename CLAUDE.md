# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

nutrition-mcp is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for nutrition-related functionality, built with Bun and TypeScript. Entry point is `src/index.ts`. Server version must be updated in three places: `package.json`, `src/mcp.ts` (McpServer constructor), and `server.json`. The server icon is at `public/favicon.ico`. Tool call analytics (duration, success/failure, error category) are tracked via `src/analytics.ts` and persisted to the `tool_analytics` table.

Data lives in a self-hosted PostgreSQL (docker-compose `postgres` service; schema in `db/init/001_schema.sql`, applied automatically on first start). All database access goes through `src/db.ts` (`Bun.sql`); auth is a local `users` table with `Bun.password` hashes (argon2id for new passwords, bcrypt accepted for imported ones) plus server-side Google id_token verification (`jose` + Google JWKS). `bun test` runs without a database — `src/db.test.ts` fakes the SQL singleton via `setSqlForTests`. Local stack: `docker compose up -d` (app + postgres).

## Releasing

This is a remote MCP server: deploying to DigitalOcean makes code changes live for clients immediately (the MCP Registry is only discovery metadata pointing at `https://nutrition-mcp.com/mcp`, so republishing is not required for a fix to take effect). To refresh the registry listing on a release, bump the version in all three places above, merge to `main`, then push a matching `v*` tag:

```
git tag v1.13.3 && git push origin v1.13.3
```

The `.github/workflows/publish-mcp.yml` workflow then runs the tests, verifies the tag matches `server.json`'s version, and publishes via `mcp-publisher` using GitHub OIDC (no secrets). Each published version must be unique and is immutable once published, so always tag a fresh version — never re-tag an already-published one.

## Commands

- `bun run src/index.ts` - Run the server
- `bun --watch src/index.ts` - Run with watch mode (restarts on file changes)
- `bun test` - Run all tests
- `bun test src/path/to/file.test.ts` - Run a single test file
- `bun run format` - Format code with Prettier (4-space indentation)

## Bun Runtime

Default to Bun for everything. Do not use Node.js equivalents.

- `bun <file>` instead of `node`/`ts-node`
- `bun install` instead of `npm install`
- `bun run <script>` instead of `npm run`
- `bunx <pkg>` instead of `npx`
- Bun auto-loads `.env` — don't use dotenv

### Preferred Bun APIs

- `Bun.serve()` for HTTP/WebSocket servers (not Express)
- `bun:sqlite` for SQLite (not better-sqlite3)
- `Bun.redis` for Redis (not ioredis)
- `Bun.sql` for Postgres (not pg/postgres.js)
- `Bun.file` for file I/O (not node:fs readFile/writeFile)
- `Bun.$\`cmd\`` for shell commands (not execa)
- Built-in `WebSocket` (not ws)

### Testing

```ts
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";
```

### Frontend (if needed)

Use HTML imports with `Bun.serve()` — not Vite. HTML files can directly import `.tsx`/`.jsx`/`.js` and Bun bundles automatically. Bun API docs: `node_modules/bun-types/docs/**.mdx`.

# Claude Code Operating Instructions

## Core Philosophy

Default to **parallel execution** and **web-verified information**. Sequential execution and offline assumptions are fallback modes, not defaults. When in doubt: parallelize, then search.

---

## 1. Parallelization Protocol

### Default Behavior: Parallel-First

**Before starting any multi-step task:**

1. Decompose the full task into atomic subtasks
2. Build a dependency graph — identify which subtasks have no prerequisite outputs
3. Dispatch ALL dependency-free subtasks simultaneously using parallel tool calls
4. Only after their completion, dispatch the next wave of now-unblocked subtasks
5. Repeat until task is complete

**Rule:** If two tasks do not share an input/output dependency, they MUST run in parallel. Sequential execution of independent tasks is a performance violation.

### Parallel Tool Call Patterns

Prefer batching tool calls in a single response turn rather than sequential turns:

```
# CORRECT — dispatch independent reads simultaneously
- Read file A
- Read file B
- Search web for library version
(all in one turn)

# WRONG — needless sequencing
- Read file A → wait → Read file B → wait → Search web
```

### Sub-Agent Parallelization (Task Tool)

When using the `Task` tool to spawn sub-agents:

- Spawn all independent sub-agents in a single dispatch batch
- Maximum **5 concurrent sub-agents** at any time to avoid context exhaustion
- Each sub-agent must have a clearly scoped, non-overlapping responsibility
- Define explicit output contracts for each agent before spawning
- After all agents complete, explicitly synthesize their outputs — do not present raw agent outputs as the final answer

### TodoWrite Protocol

When managing complex tasks with `TodoWrite`:

- Mark tasks as `in_progress` before starting a parallel batch
- Track each parallel thread separately
- Never mark a parent task `completed` until all parallel children resolve
- Flag dependency chains explicitly in todo descriptions

### When Sequential Execution Is Permitted

Sequential execution is only justified when:

- Task B requires Task A's output as direct input
- Tasks write to the same file or resource (race condition risk)
- A previous parallel batch returned an error that changes downstream logic
- User explicitly requests step-by-step confirmation

In all other cases: **parallelize**.

---

## 2. Web Search Mandate

### Search-First Triggers

**Always perform a web search before proceeding** when the task involves any of the following:

| Category                     | Examples                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Library / framework versions | "What's the latest stable version of X?"                  |
| API behavior and signatures  | Any external SDK, REST API, or CLI tool                   |
| Security advisories          | CVEs, deprecated patterns, breaking changes               |
| Best practices               | Architecture patterns, language idioms updated post-2024  |
| Configuration options        | Tool flags, environment variables, cloud service settings |
| Error messages               | Unfamiliar stack traces, runtime errors                   |
| Compatibility questions      | Node/Python/Rust version support, browser APIs            |
| Pricing or limits            | Cloud service quotas, rate limits, SLA details            |

### Search Behavior Rules

1. **Search before assuming.** Do not rely on training knowledge for anything that changes over time. External information has a shelf life; always verify.

2. **Prefer official sources.** When web results conflict, prioritize: official docs > GitHub releases > well-known technical blogs > forums.

3. **Deduplicate within session.** If you have already searched for a query in this session and the result was unambiguous, do not re-search the same query. Cache the result mentally and reference it.

4. **Surface what you found.** When you use web search to inform a decision, briefly state the source and key fact. Do not silently use search results without attribution.

5. **Parallelize searches.** When multiple independent facts need to be looked up, dispatch all web searches simultaneously, not sequentially.

6. **Do not search for:** Internal project details, proprietary architecture, code that exists in the repository (read the file instead), or subjective style decisions.

### When Web Search Results Conflict with the Codebase

If web search returns guidance that contradicts patterns already established in the repo:

1. Note the conflict explicitly
2. Present both the current repo pattern and the web-sourced alternative
3. Do not silently override existing code with web-sourced patterns without user confirmation

---

## 3. Session Start Checklist

At the beginning of every new task or session, run the following in parallel:

- [ ] Read `CLAUDE.md` (this file) to confirm operating rules are loaded
- [ ] Identify the task's scope and decompose into subtasks
- [ ] Flag any subtasks that require web verification
- [ ] Check for existing relevant files in the repo before searching externally
- [ ] Dispatch first parallel batch

---

## 4. Quality and Safety Rules

- **No unverified version pinning.** Never write a dependency version (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.) without confirming via web search that it is current and non-deprecated.
- **No silent failures in parallel batches.** If one parallel subtask fails, halt dependent tasks immediately and report the failure before proceeding.
- **Conflict resolution in parallel file edits.** If two parallel sub-agents are asked to modify the same file, serialize those specific edits. All other work continues in parallel.
- **Do not hallucinate tool flags or API parameters.** If unsure whether a CLI flag exists, search first.

---

## 5. Communication Standards

- When executing a parallel batch, briefly state what is running in parallel and why
- When web search informs a decision, cite source and date if available
- When sequential execution is chosen over parallel, briefly state the dependency that forced it
- Keep explanations concise — action over narration
